* Working with Encodings -- in hs.text
*     - (BOOL)canBeConvertedToEncoding:(NSStringEncoding)encoding;    -- we already check for nil in NSData conversion, so duplicattion of effort

- Transforming Strings
  -     - (NSString *)stringByApplyingTransform:(NSStringTransform)transform reverse:(BOOL)reverse;
  -         partially complete; need better understanding of http://userguide.icu-project.org/transforms/general

  Identifying and Comparing Strings

  Dividing Strings
      - (NSArray<NSString *> *)componentsSeparatedByString:(NSString *)separator;
      - (NSArray<NSString *> *)componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:(NSCharacterSet *)separator;
          Think separating into hs.text objects at newline
      - (NSString *)stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:(NSCharacterSet *)set;
          Think trimming whitespace from begining and ending
  *   - (NSString *)substringWithRange:(NSRange)range;
