hs.text.http
============

Perform HTTP requests with hs.text objects

This submodule is a subset of the `hs.http` module modified to return `hs.text` objects for the response body of http requests. For http methods which allow submitting a body (e.g. POST), `hs.text` object may be used instead of lua strings as well.

### Usage
~~~lua
http = require("hs.text").http
~~~

### Module Functions

<a name="asyncGet"></a>
~~~lua
http.asyncGet(url, headers, callback)
~~~
Sends an HTTP GET request asynchronously

Parameters:
 * `url`      - A string containing the URL to retrieve
 * `headers`  - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers
 * `callback` - A function to be called when the request succeeds or fails. The function will be passed three parameters:
  * A number containing the HTTP response status
  * A textObject containing the response body
  * A table containing the response headers

Notes:
 * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

 * If the request fails, the callback function's first parameter will be negative and the second parameter will contain an error message. The third parameter will be nil

<a name="asyncPost"></a>
~~~lua
http.asyncPost(url, data, headers, callback)
~~~
Sends an HTTP POST request asynchronously

Parameters:
 * `url`      - A string containing the URL to submit to
 * `data`     - A string or hs.text object containing the request body, or nil to send no body
 * `headers`  - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers
 * `callback` - A function to be called when the request succeeds or fails. The function will be passed three parameters:
  * A number containing the HTTP response status
  * A textObject containing the response body
  * A table containing the response headers

Notes:
 * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

 * If the request fails, the callback function's first parameter will be negative and the second parameter will contain an error message. The third parameter will be nil

<a name="doAsyncRequest"></a>
~~~lua
http.doAsyncRequest(url, method, data, headers, callback, [cachePolicy])
~~~
Creates an HTTP request and executes it asynchronously

Parameters:
 * `url`         - A string containing the URL
 * `method`      - A string containing the HTTP method to use (e.g. "GET", "POST", etc)
 * `data`        - A string or `hs.text` object containing the request body, or nil to send no body
 * `headers`     - A table containing string keys and values representing request header keys and values, or nil to add no headers
 * `callback`    - A function to called when the response is received. The function should accept three arguments:
  * `code`    - A number containing the HTTP response code
  * `body`    - An `hs.text` object containing the body of the response
  * `headers` - A table containing the HTTP headers of the response
 * `cachePolicy` - An optional string containing the cache policy ("protocolCachePolicy", "ignoreLocalCache", "ignoreLocalAndRemoteCache", "returnCacheOrLoad", "returnCacheDontLoad" or "reloadRevalidatingCache"). Defaults to `protocolCachePolicy`.

Returns:
 * None

Notes:
 * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.
 * If the Content-Type response header begins `text/` then the response body return value is a UTF8 string. Any other content type passes the response body, unaltered, as a stream of bytes.

<a name="doRequest"></a>
~~~lua
http.doRequest(url, method, [data, headers, cachePolicy]) -> int, textObject, table
~~~
Creates an HTTP request and executes it synchronously

Parameters:
 * `url`         - A string containing the URL
 * `method`      - A string containing the HTTP method to use (e.g. "GET", "POST", etc)
 * `data`        - An optional string or `hs.text` object containing the data to POST to the URL, or nil to send no data
 * `headers`     - An optional table of string keys and values used as headers for the request, or nil to add no headers
 * `cachePolicy` - An optional string containing the cache policy ("protocolCachePolicy", "ignoreLocalCache", "ignoreLocalAndRemoteCache", "returnCacheOrLoad", "returnCacheDontLoad" or "reloadRevalidatingCache"). Defaults to `protocolCachePolicy`.

Returns:
 * A number containing the HTTP response status code
 * An `hs.text` object containing the response body
 * A table containing the response headers

Notes:
 * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

 * This function is synchronous and will therefore block all Lua execution until it completes. You are encouraged to use the asynchronous functions.
 * If you attempt to connect to a local Hammerspoon server created with `hs.httpserver`, then Hammerspoon will block until the connection times out (60 seconds), return a failed result due to the timeout, and then the `hs.httpserver` callback function will be invoked (so any side effects of the function will occur, but it's results will be lost).  Use [hs.text.http.doAsyncRequest](#doAsyncRequest) to avoid this.
 * If the Content-Type response header begins `text/` then the response body return value is a UTF8 string. Any other content type passes the response body, unaltered, as a stream of bytes.

<a name="get"></a>
~~~lua
http.get(url, headers) -> int, textObject, table
~~~
Sends an HTTP GET request to a URL

Parameters
 * `url`     - A string containing the URL to retrieve
 * `headers` - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers

Returns:
 * A number containing the HTTP response status
 * A textObject containing the response body
 * A table containing the response headers

Notes:
 * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

 * This function is synchronous and will therefore block all other Lua execution while the request is in progress, you are encouraged to use the asynchronous functions
 * If you attempt to connect to a local Hammerspoon server created with `hs.httpserver`, then Hammerspoon will block until the connection times out (60 seconds), return a failed result due to the timeout, and then the `hs.httpserver` callback function will be invoked (so any side effects of the function will occur, but it's results will be lost).  Use [hs.text.http.asyncGet](#asyncGet) to avoid this.

<a name="post"></a>
~~~lua
http.post(url, data, headers) -> int, textObject, table
~~~
Sends an HTTP POST request to a URL

Parameters
 * `url`     - A string containing the URL to submit to
 * `data`    - A string or hs.text object containing the request body, or nil to send no body
 * `headers` - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers

Returns:
 * A number containing the HTTP response status
 * A textObject containing the response body
 * A table containing the response headers

Notes:
 * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

 * This function is synchronous and will therefore block all other Lua execution while the request is in progress, you are encouraged to use the asynchronous functions
 * If you attempt to connect to a local Hammerspoon server created with `hs.httpserver`, then Hammerspoon will block until the connection times out (60 seconds), return a failed result due to the timeout, and then the `hs.httpserver` callback function will be invoked (so any side effects of the function will occur, but it's results will be lost).  Use [hs.text.http.asyncPost](#asyncPost) to avoid this.
